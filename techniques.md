# The Hivemind Manifesto

## _Opinions are good. We have strong ones._
Over the last year, we've finished a few projects, started a lot more, and generally refined our ideas between each 
other about what we thought Hivemind is, what we think works, what we think sucks, and what perfection is to us. 

To us, opinionated design is the kind that sticks out, and we want to share those opinions of ours, because that's the point of the internet, right? 

## What exactly _is_ this? 
This is a style guide for your code, for your design, and for your life as a developer. It's a living, breathing, evergreen guide based on our opinions, experience, and how we do things here at Hivemind.

# 1. Philosophy and Personality 

## Perfection and Minimalism  

To us, and to me personally, minimal approaches work out best, and we try to extend this philosophy into everything
we build here. 

From visual aesthetics, to the actual code powering our apps, we strive for the minimal but most effective approach.

This means a few things to us in application. 

* **1.1 Don't use generators**
They start you off with code bloat, and you'll spend just as much time deleting unused code as it would have taken you to just bootstrap the application structure yourself.
	
* **1.2 Simple and concise variable names**
	
* **1.3 Structure is just as important as contents**
Every app we produce follows a very specific folder architecture for both server and client code. 

* **1.4 You are not your online profile**
Your Facebook profile isn't going to outlive you. Your creation and progress as a human is what will outlast you. If you want to live forever, build a legacy first. 

* **1.6 Your time is too valuable to be dependent on digital notifications**
Your time is your most valuable asset. Your notifications should be kept to a minimum. Focus on your work and creating something that's meaningful. 

* **1.7 A screen will not be the first and last thing you see**
Technology is a way to enhance the experiences you have as a human on this planet, not hinder them. 

* **1.8 Tangible will always take precedence over digitaI'm al**
In application, this means your clients will always prefer getting a physical report to receiving just an email. They'll prefer seeing their business cards 
in person rather than seeing _mockups_ of their business cards. 

* **1.9 People don't know what they want until they see it**

* **1.10 Your time is the most valuable asset you have**

* **1.11 Be careful what you get good at**

* **1.12 You can either be good, get good, or give up. Choose one.**

* **1.13 Find inspiration everywhere**
Surround yourself with different textures, media, experiences, everything. Don't let it all be digital, either.

* **1.14 You are not your computer**
Your computer isn't you. You are a user, using the tools you have to create your vision and concepts.

## 2. Concept and Scope

* **2.1 The quickest way to decrease quality is to increase scope.** 

Your project's scope should be laser sharp and perfectly defined down to every user interaction. 
The concept should be solid, and you should have numbers rather than opinions to back up _why_ you're creating something. 

* **2.2 Numbers rule, people lie.**

* **2.1 Have a very well defined user flow and wireframe for every feature before you even think about development.**

* **2.2 An increase in scope should mean an increase (push back) in deadline and an increase in cost.**

* **2.3 Every concept should be thoroughly vetted and examined by all persons.**

* **2.4 Use a web app template and expand on it.**

## 3. Design

3.1 Settle on a grid system and stick to it, whichever you choose.

3.2 Create a base set of templates and deliverables for each project type.

3.3 Create a style tile template that each project will start with. 

This should include a typography example, color palette, and examples of main UI elements such as buttons, links, checkboxes, cards, etc... 

Create a set of templates for your design projects that all projects should start on. I suggest creating templates for logo design, business card design, multiple sizes of collateral, letterhead, and icons for all devices and sizes.

Use semantic filenames.

## 4. Development 

* **4.1 Deploy early, adjust slightly**

Get your entire planned stack for the app deployed and working together nicely. This will help you with rollout and you won't be scrambling last minute to get your app deployed on a deadline and will let you focus on features for the tight deadlines rather than dev-ops. 

* **4.2 Use docker**

This ties in with the above point. Docker is killer for deployment, and will help you create a scalable architecture for your apps. Use it. 

* **4.3 Get in the habit of using a CI/CD system**

* **4.4 Write documentation before, during, and after your project**

Write a lot more documentation. a new person should be able to come in to your project, clone the code base, fix an issue on the server, or fix a bug in your code just because of how good your documentation is.

* **4.5 Create an in house style guide**

* **4.6 Run a linter**

* **4.7 Use a build system, and constantly improve it**

* **4.8 Maintain a blog**

* **4.9 Use semantic function names**

* **4.10 Comments should read why, not what**

Comment your code, but comment why you made a change or why you do something. Your code should be readable enough to begin with that you shouldn't need to comment unless you have to do something different or something that the code doesn't inherently explain.

* **4.11 Develop to a design**
Don't design around the development. You should have very clear wire frames for every screen and function of your app.
