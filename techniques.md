# The Hivemind Manifesto

## _Opinions are good. We have strong ones._
Over the last year, we've finished a few projects, started a lot more, and generally refined our ideas between each 
other about what we thought Hivemind is, what we think works, what we think sucks, and what perfection is to us. 

To us, opinionated design is the kind that sticks out. 

# Perfection and Minimalism 

To us, and to me personally, minimal approaches work out best, and we try to extend this philosophy into everything
we build here. 

From visual aesthetics, to the actual code powering our apps, we strive for the minimal but most effective approach.

This means a few things to us in application: 

	1. Don't use generators. They start you off with code bloat, and you'll spend just as much time deleting unused code
as it would have taken you to just bootstrap the application structure yourself.
	2. Simple and concise variable names 
	3. Structure is just as important as contents. Every app we produce follows a very specific folder architecture for both server and client code.
