# The Hivemind Manifesto

## _Opinions are good. We have strong ones._
Over the last year, we've finished a few projects, started a lot more, and generally refined our ideas between each 
other about what we thought Hivemind is, what we think works, what we think sucks, and what perfection is to us. 

To us, opinionated design is the kind that sticks out, and we want to share those opinions of ours, because that's the point of the internet, right?

# 1. Philosophy 

## Perfection and minimalism  

To us, and to me personally, minimal approaches work out best, and we try to extend this philosophy into everything
we build here. 

From visual aesthetics, to the actual code powering our apps, we strive for the minimal but most effective approach.

This means a few things to us in application. 


#### 1.1 Don't use generators. They start you off with code bloat, and you'll spend just as much time deleting unused code as it would have taken you to just bootstrap the application structure yourself.
	
#### 1.2 Simple and concise variable names 
	
#### 1.3 Structure is just as important as contents. Every app we produce follows a very specific folder architecture for both server and client code. 



## 2. Concept and Scope

The quickest way to decrease quality is to increase scope. Your project's scope should be laser sharp and perfectly defined down to every user interaction. 

#### 2.1 Have a very well defined user flow and wireframe for every feature before you even think about development. 

#### 2.2 An increase in scope should mean an increase (push back) in deadline and an increase in cost.
