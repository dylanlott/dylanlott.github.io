Hi there. I'm Dylan. I'm a designer, developer, coffee addict, starcraft fanboy, self-deprecationist, musician, and hobbyist car mechanic. 

I'm currently involved in or working on: 

* [BandForge](https://www.bandforgeapp.com)
* [Zaniac](https://zaniaclearning.com)
* [BuiltRight](http://builtrightapp.com)

You can check out more of my professional work on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/dylanlott) and then creepily stalk me on [Instgram](www.instagram.com/dylanxedge) if you'd like to.
