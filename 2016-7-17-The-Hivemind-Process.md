# Initial Research
- [ ] Figure out project scope and features 
- [ ] Determine deadlines for project
- [ ] Write out all app features and use cases 
- [ ] Send contract to client with deadline for signing

# Finalize Contracts
We donâ€™t move an inch until we have a contract signed and the project scope nailed down. Once the contract is signed, we dive into our research and set up the project. 

- [ ] Sign and finalize contracts
- [ ] Scan contracts into computer and create digital backup 
- [ ] Send confirmation letter to client with important dates and milestones. 

# Create Project Folder and Organization
We use the following folder configuration and project organization. We set these up in Dropbox and back everything up to the Dropbox folder. This way, project delivery is as simple as sending the client the project folder link.

- [ ] Create Trello or Asana board 
- [ ] Invite client into project management tool 
- [ ] Set up physical calendar with deadlines and goal dates marked clearly 
- [ ] Print out project tracker (https://www.evernote.com/l/AOpJV1doW0dAjoKex5YN1qLLL6H0LGOdO6M)
- [ ] Design Iterations
- [ ] Begin turning features into more specific use cases and stories. 
- [ ] Wireframing and prototyping starts 
- [ ] Begin client iteration process on wireframes
- [ ] Create high resolution mockups, interactive mockups of each feature and use case
- [ ] A/B test mockups with potential clients and customers 
- [ ] Refine features and use cases 
- [ ] Send mockups to client for approval and final write off.

# Development and Coding 
Be very, very, cautious before entering the development stage. Changes here take twice the effort and three times as long. The goal with the development phase is to get to `push to deploy` status with the project as early as possible to make iteration and testing faster and easier. 

## Setup Phase
- [ ] Layout tech stack and draw up how everything will interact together. 
- [ ] Settle on define style guide and build process.
- [ ] Create git repos for the project and adhere to GitLab Flow 
- [ ] Create seed template that uses all major pieces in the stack (database, front end, server)
- [ ] Buy the domain name for the project or receive the login information for it
- [ ] Deploy the project seed
- [ ] Setup the continuous delivery and integration system (CircleCI, Travis, etc..) 
- [ ] Setup backup folders for code and assets in DropBox
- [ ] Create README with installation notes and other key info for initial setup
- [ ] Settle on branch naming convention
- [ ] Create slack channels for the project

## Design Phase
- [ ] Create base index template
- [ ] Create base stylesheet
- [ ] Set base colors according to style guide
- [ ] Create living style guide page
- [ ] Layout all major pages and features with mock data and mock JSON files.

## Development Phase
- [ ] Maintain a bug tracking sheet
- [ ] Track progress
- [ ] Daily standups / daily communication
