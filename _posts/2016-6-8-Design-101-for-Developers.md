Are you an engineer? Are you terrible at design? Follow this guide to get a real quick better sense of design. 

I've made them into small, bite-sized rules that you can follow, cause we all know engineers love rules and sticking to them. 


## 1. White space is your friend - Double the whitespace between stuff. 


## 2. Use a framework 

Stop trying to custom write your CSS. You'll tell me you're "an engineer, not a designer", but you won't use Bootstrap? Come on. 


## 3. A little type goes a long way. 

In general, avoid at all costs the basic fonts. Just using a custom font will get you 80% there in most cases. 


## 4. Screenshots are your friend

When it comes to making your site feel less "copy and paste", there's very few things you can do that are better than adding new and custom content. 
One of the best ways to do this is screen grabs or pictures of whatever you're creating a page for. 

99% of the time, you engineers are creating pages for software you wrote, so I'm just going to assume that's the case and say get [Clipular](https://www.clipular.com) and grab some screenshots of whatever app you're working on and throw them into your landing page. Center those images, slap the `img-responsive` class from Bootstrap onto them and call it a day. 

*Feeling adventurous?* Try `img-rounded` out and really blow your mind.
