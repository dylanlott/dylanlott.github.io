# What is DevOps? 

DevOps is the meshing of development and operations. This is where apps come to life, but it's also where things can get nebulous. 
Operations and deployments can touch on a lot of technologies and concepts, and it can seem like a mountain to someone who hasn't worked on it much before. 

Don't let this stop you from getting familiar with it. Much like development, operations has recently seen a massive uptick in technologies and strategies
for taking apps to production. With Docker leading the way, there's been a moderate explosion in devops in the last few years. This is a good thing. 

I'd venture to say it's never been easier to launch your own app than it is right now, thanks to tech like Docker and Nginx being so readily available. 

## Assumptions 

If you're reading this, I'm going to assume a few things about your skillset and knowledge. 

1. You are very new to dev ops/operations in general.
2. You have some programming experience. (~6 months experience, at minimum)
3. You're comfortable in the terminal.

You don't have to be a senior dev or have a Bachelor's degree in computer science, but you should feel comfortable in the terminal and be able to get around.
Being a vim master is not requisite, just the ability to run and tweak basic scripts to your need will be required. The more you can script dev-ops, the better off you'll be. 


## Format 

This is going to serve as a rather exhaustive master-list of smaller tutorial series and articles to get you up to speed on how to run your own devops. 

Each post will take the following format: 

- A pre-requisites section 
- The meat of the article 
- List of tech used in the tutorial
- If applicable, a "next" section where I'll recommend where to progress from there or continue on.
