title: From Minimum Wage to Six Figures A Year In 18 Months 
---

1. I was poor as fuck.

After living below the poverty line for so many years, you learn to appreciate some things. I was poor, and I was getting sick of it. Websites and computers had always interested me (I taught myself HTML and CSS when I was in 5th grade, and then started reading C++ books when I was in 6th and 7th grade) but college seemed too expensive and 4 years was not the kind of time commitment I wanted. I was willing to put in work, but not wait 4 years to see the results of it. 

2. I found DevMountain

I had been working a night shift at a rehab center, basically making sure the kids didn't run away. This was a good job, because it allowed me time to study web development more in depth and decide that I actually did want to pull the trigger and do this. I found DevMountain during this period of time. 

3. Bust my ass 

4. My first job 

I was lucky enough to get a job the day I graduated from DevMountain. 

5. Never stop creating
