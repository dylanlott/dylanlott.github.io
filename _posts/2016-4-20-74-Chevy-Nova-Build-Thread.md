title: 1974 Chevy Nova Build Thread
---

## Humble Start
In October 2015 I bought a 1974 Chevy Nova.
It had a 350 small block chevy motor in it that had been mildly rebuilt and was joined
up to a 700R4 transmission.

When I got the car, it had a 71' front and rear bumper / grille swap.

## Build Goals
- 600 horsepower
- 600 ft lbs torque
- Supercharged
- Daily driveable and street legal.
- Not just driveable, but _comfortable_.

## Water in the block
Over the winter, water somehow got into the block. This is a problem, as you might have guessed.
We pulled the plugs, drained all the water out, and put the car back until we have a new engine ready
for it.

## Next Steps
We figured we have two options now -
1) Get a new block
2) Resurface and hone the old block.

After getting a few quotes on some machine work, we quickly discovered it would be about the same
amount of money to just get a brand new block.

## Choosing a new block
I decided to go with a 383 stroker setup with forged internals.

Why?

Because racecar, because horsepower.  

From a 383, with a set of heads and a cam, we can easily be at 400+ hp and torque.
With our supercharger bolted on, a fuel delivery rebuild, and a solid 650hp rated transmission,
we think this build is more than viable for a gobs-of-horsepower in a daily and still reliable.
