From Minimum Wage to a Six Figure Job - A 16 Month Journey

# The Bottom

I don't come from money. I was never poverty-level poor, my parents always provided for me, but I worked a job from the time I was 12,
and from that point forward I bought myself pretty much everything I needed except the yearly clothes run and food. Everything else was up to me.

Fast forward 10 years and I'm 22, working a as a night guard at a drug rehab center for youth. At this point in my life I had started a record
label, a band management / booking company, and co-founded a marketing agency. The artist management company failed brilliantly and the
marketing agency was disbanded after the CEO was acqui-hired by a local marketing company, leaving me without a career once again.

At the marketing agency, I had become more interested in web design and began doing web work for clients of ours as an added bonus/benefit.

This sparked my curiosity and I became more interested in how to program and code sites and apps. While working at the treatment center,
I started studying on my own and this is where I dipped my toes into the world of web development.

But it wasn't fast enough.

I'm a sort of impatient dude, I like to see results fairly quickly. I was learning, and I had a decent grasp of some fundamental concepts
of Ruby on Rails (the language I was firs studying) but I hadn't yet had it all click. I had no idea how it _all worked together_.

This is something that's fairly important to me in the learning process: I need to see how everything works together. It's something
I still think isn't explained very well in blog posts.

For about 4 months, I worked and studied at night, teaching myself and trying my hardest to learn as fast as I could. Then, one night,
I was on Facebook and an ad popped up: Learn to code in 3 months. I was intrigued, and researched it further. This was my first introduction
to code bootcamps and it was fascinating to me. I had always liked the vocational career paths (I almost became a welder and a mechanic) and
it was basically the perfect solution for me.

A month later, I had signed up and been accepted to DevMountain. Hooray.

# The Come Up

So now what?

_Keep studying._

I kept studying. I studied basically every night until I was supposed to move into the DevMountain housing. I studied the first night I was there.
Study. Drink coffee. Study. Text my girlfriend. Study. It was endless. I became a robot.

This became the natural rhythm for the next 3 months. Sprinkle in some time at the gym, weekend visits to hang out with my old crew, and some hikes with my
girlfriend, and you have my entire life. I became one with the culture. I assimilated. Yes, I'm okay with that. I'm enlightened.

# The Important Shit

If you plan on doing a code bootcamp, you need to understand only one thing: They're not handing you anything. You have to work for it.
You have to be motivated, you have to be quick, and you have to adapt. I spent 13 weeks completely immersed in code. It won't be easy.
You're going to drown yourself in internet articles and blogs.

The coffee is brewed, the Wi-Fi is on, it's up to you to do the rest.

By the time you're done you'll have really strong opinions on blogs and snobby preferences on keyboards and a smug sense of moral superiority over
people who still have a positive world view but dammit, you'll be a better developer for it.

Group projects and solo projects are your life. You want to live and breathe those projects. Spit shine that project until you want to puke
when you think about working on it more. And then accept that this first major project was shit and you only learned that you're shit, too.

This is the cycle of web development and you should embrace it, even be _thankful for it_.

Your projects are what define you. Finish them. Slave over them. They're your children. Hate them appropriately and praise them responsibly.

# The First
The day after I graduated DevMountain, I had a job offer with a kick ass company. Did I work for it? Yes. Did I get lucky? I think it was more of
a positive set of coincidences. Was I ecstatic? Hell yeah I was.

Your first job is extremely important. You should be networking the entire time you're in school (if you decide to do a bootcamp). Go to meetups.
Drink coffee with the regulars. Shoot the shit. Learn to have a fucking opinion, a valid opinion, a well-thought and evidenced opinion.

Fortunately, there was a ton of meetups that used the DevMountain space, so basically every week I was able to go to a different meetup, get pizza,
and talk to developers. I even found _freelance work_ like this. While I was still in school! It was incredible.

Don't underestimate the value of networking. I got my first job because I went to elementary school with the CEO and high school with the CTO.
I got my second job because I was decently known at Node meetups and had a few endorsements for it on LinkedIn. I'm sure my next job will be just
as coin

# The Journey

I just took a job making over six figures, and looking back, it happened so fast that I can barely process it. Money isn't everything, but if anyone
told you that money doesn't buy you happiness, holy fuck _were they wrong_. I'm enjoying it while it lasts, cause hey, we're in a bubble and I'm gonna
get fucked when it bursts, but for right now, I'm cashing checks and writing code.

This blog article isn't supposed to be educational, more philosophical. There's a whole world out there that people let slip by them.


I'm being flown right now to the NodeJS summit in San Francisco, to meet the team of my new job. It's surreal. I'm still waiting
