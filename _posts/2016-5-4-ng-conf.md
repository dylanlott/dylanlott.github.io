## Day 1

Some links I saved from Day 1 of ng-conf and some other notes 

* Angular 2 is now at Release Candidate 1! 
* [https://www.nativescript.org/](https://www.nativescript.org/) - Today they announced that NativeScript will have ng2 compatibility and they seem to be pushing NativeScript as their preferred framework for cross-platform apps. 
* [https://angular.io/styleguide](https://angular.io/styleguide) - They released the official Angular 2 Style Guide 
* [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.Angular2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.Angular2) John Papa put out some ng2 snippets that are pretty useful 
* [https://mobile.angular.io/](https://mobile.angular.io/) - The Angular 2 team also talked more about Angular Mobile and their push towards "progressive" web apps and blurring the lines between web apps and native apps. 
* [https://github.com/angular/angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) - Probably my favorite announcement made today is their new CLI for Angular 2 that will handle a lot of the setup and makes creation of a new app as easy as `ng new myApp && cd myApp && ng serve`
* [https://augury.angular.io/](https://augury.angular.io/) - Cool debugging and tracing tool that the Angular team is putting out. 

### Notes 
* Angular 2 is now smaller than Angular 1.5, coming in under 50kb zipped and minified. 
* They've also reduced ng2 load times by _5x_ on both initial render and re-renders (as compared to 1.5.X)
* Angular Universal is now capable of handling browser operations such as local storage and sessions. 
* Angular Universal support with native and desktop applications has been made a lot more robust and fast as well. 

Stay tuned! I'll be adding more notes to this after the workshops tomorrow and posting any other links I find useful or interesting. 

## Day 2 

* Tree shaking and minification allows them to get down to about 47k side library.
* They refactored the import system in Angular so that they only load the imports necessary to run the app (e.g. they don't load the compiler for runtime) 
* Initial load time for the entire Angular 2 library in the browser is under half a second.
* 10k Hello World - Team Goal


## Day 3 
* [https://github.com/angular/angularfire2](AngularFire2) has reached Beta.
