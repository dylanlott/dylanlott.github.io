title: Running A Team
---

In the last year, I've been working in my spare time on building a brand under the name Hivemind. It's been an interesting year, and it takes up most of my time, but I wanted to share some of what I've learned. Running a team of people and managing them towards a common goal is much more difficult than I thought it would be.

# 1\. Tools of the Trade

## Don't get caught up in "using the right tool".

What I mean by this is you shouldn't be concerned with "what tool should I use?" or "What's the best project management tool out there?"

This kind of thinking is slowing you down. Just pick one and use it. If you notice a _huge_ issue (and I mean, it seriously better be directly affecting profits) then yeah, switch, but don't spend more than an hour figuring out what you need to switch to.

I spent too much time mulling over exactly this question and had a realization that I should have been coding and working on closing sales for the shop rather than getting in the finer details of "what project management tool does this best?".

Right now, I'm using Asana, and it does everything I need it to for free. I don't think about what tool I'm using anymore, I just use it.

# 2\. Managing People

As I touched on earlier, one of the hardest lessons I've learned is how to manage people.

People are finnicky. It's in their nature. You need to be firm but friendly. You need to be a leader. I know this sounds cheesy, I get it, but it's true. You're supposed to be the one making decisions.

If you're indecisive, your people will question you. This isn't a bad thing, but over-questioning you can lead to lack of faith, and that _is_ a bad thing.

A few tips I've found can be broken down into some bite sized tips:

- Make decisions quickly and make them based on facts.
- Give people small, bite-sized tasks. (If you're working on a large proejct, it's _your_ job to break that large project up INTO these small bite-sized tasks.)
- Always have a plan, even if it's just a few bullet points.
- Show your people the overall plan and vision. Show them what you want the company to be.
