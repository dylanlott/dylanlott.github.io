# Concept

So I originally wanted to build a simple app for car owners and enthusiasts to track their builds and see how much money they spent on them, as well as track and share exactly what parts went into their cars. 

The amount of time and effort that gets put into cars has always been a subject of admiration for me. I've been into cars my whole life, and recently started my own Chevy Nova build, so this project felt right to start.

# Features

Right now, you can add a register, login, add a build, and logout, and not much more. 
It's a barebones app, but within the next few weeks I plan to add more features, namely: 

[ ] Adding a part to a build 
[ ] Updating your build
[ ] Build cost totals
[ ] Build maintenance costs (might be useful when selling your car) 
[ ] Build timelines 
[ ] Removing a part 
[ ] Parts / Builds for sale (classifieds section)
[ ] Discussion forum (this will be a pretty involved feature, but I want to get this done soon for the social value)

and a lot more. 

Stay tuned, there will definitely be more to come! 

# Update - July 5th 2016 

Today, I deployed the application at [www.builtrightapp.com](BuiltRightApp.com) and it's running swimmingly. 

### Stack Info 

I used Node and MongoDB for the data layer, PM2 to handle the server running and clustering, Express to handle the routing and controllers, and Angular for the front end.
